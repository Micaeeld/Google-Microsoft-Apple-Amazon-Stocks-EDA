## Insights

### Google:
  • The more than 100% growth in Google stock from 2014 to 2018 indicates solid performance by the company during that period, reflecting Google's continued dominance in the technology and online advertising market.
  • The sharp drop at the end of the period suggests the possibility of a specific event or market shift that negatively affected Google's stock, which can be investigated to better understand the factors behind this drop.
  • The average trading volume of Google shares, reaching 2 million in 2015 and 1.5 million in 2017, demonstrates investor interest in this leading technology company.

### Amazon:

    • The impressive growth of more than 500% in Amazon stock from 2014 to 2018 highlights the company's exceptional success during this period, consolidating its leadership position in e-commerce and its diversification into areas such as cloud services and content streaming.
  
    • The average trading volume of Amazon shares has remained relatively stable over the years, but the significant increase in 2018, surpassing 5 million, indicates an increase in investor interest and may be related to relevant events in the corporate scenario.

### Microsoft:

    • Microsoft stock growth of more than 300% from 2013 to 2018 highlights the company's successful transformation under Satya Nadella's leadership, positioning it as a leader in cloud services and enterprise solutions.
  
    • The average trading volume of Microsoft shares, close to 50 million in 2013, falling to less than 25 million in 2017 and remaining between 30 and 35 million in other years, reflects the evolution of the market and the stabilization after a period of expressive growth .
  
### Apple:

    • The growth trajectory of Apple shares until the beginning of 2018, with a peak of 180 USD in January and a sharp drop in February, demonstrates the strength of the brand and the demand for the company's products. However, the sharp drop hints at the possibility of disruptive events or investor concerns.

    • Apple's stock average trading volume, reaching 95 million in 2013, decreasing to 27 million in 2017 and increasing to 37 million in 2018, indicates changes in investor confidence and interest over time.

### General Comparison:

    • The similar stock trajectory of Microsoft and Apple, despite differing average trading volumes, underscores the strength of these leading technology companies with popular products and services.

    • While Google started with higher opening shares, Microsoft managed to overtake it in 2016 and 2017, showing its continued growth and market impact.

    • Apple and Microsoft shares had the highest trading volumes, while Amazon and Google had the lowest volumes. The fact that these companies have higher trading volumes than Amazon and Google may be influenced by the price per share of these companies, with Apple and Microsoft having shares that are more accessible to a wider audience.
